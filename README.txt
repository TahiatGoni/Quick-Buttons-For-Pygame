Uses pygame library: https://www.pygame.org/news


This is a very simple to use tool

Import the python file into your project (ButtonClass.py)

An instance of the button needs to be created

Using the drawOnScreen(Screen) method, the button can be drawn on a particular pygame screen

Using the checkHover(Screen) method, it can be checked if the mouse is hovering over the button

Using the setColor((R,G,B)) method, button color can be set

Using the setTextColor((R,G,B)) method, text color can be set




I hope this code helps you on your coding projects :)
